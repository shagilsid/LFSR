1. Ant Colony Optimisation: is a search meta heuristic
2. Meta-heuristic: Deals with optimization problems using metaheuristic algorithms. 
3. Properties of meta-heurisitic:
    1.Metaheuristics are strategies that guide the search process.
    2.The goal is to efficiently explore the search space in order to find nearâ€“optimal solutions.
    3. Techniques which constitute metaheuristic algorithms range from simple local search procedures to complex learning processes.
    4. Metaheuristic algorithms are approximate and usually non-deterministic.
    5. Metaheuristics are not problem-specific.
4.LFSR:
5. Known Plain text attack: During known-plaintext attacks, the attacker has an access to the ciphertext 
    and its corresponding plaintext. His goal is to guess the secret key (or a number of secret keys) or 
    to develop an algorithm which would allow him to decrypt any further messages.
6.In LFSR known plaintext attack is used to discober the *primitive polynomial* used in LFSR
7. Primitive polynomial: A primitive polynomial is a polynomial that generates all elements of an 
    extension field from a base field. Primitive polynomials are also irreducible polynomials. 
    For any prime or prime power q and any positive integer n, there exists a primitive polynomial of degree n 
    over GF(q). [https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimitivePolynomial.html]
